# Algorithms
This is consisting of some basics searching and sorting algorithms that we used to study in our engineering.The programs that are provided in this repository are basically gives us a formal understanding of algorithms.The programs are written in such a way that the data types used are static but we can make changes a little bit in the code than we can use these programs in a standard format.
